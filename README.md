This is a simple radio project based on arduino and rda5807 chip.
To build the binary code Arduino IDE 1.6.7 used.

The full version, Radio_5110 compilation output:
  Sketch uses 24,416 bytes (79%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30,720 bytes.
  Global variables use 1,528 bytes (74%) of dynamic memory, leaving 520 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2,048 bytes.

The lite version, Radio_5110_lite (without automatic backlight control and station history) compilation output:
  Sketch uses 22,916 bytes (74%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30,720 bytes.
  Global variables use 1,492 bytes (72%) of dynamic memory, leaving 556 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2,048 bytes.
